# Bayesian Structural Risk Measurement Model

This project is currently work in progress.  The goal is to develop a Bayesian model for operational risk capital estimation using a convolution of frequency distribution and severity distribution.  Subject matter expertise can be incorporate into modeling through the prior distributions.
